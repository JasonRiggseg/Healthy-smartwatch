# Healthy Smartwatch
This is my project of a smartwatch that is based on NodeMCU microcontroller and also works with Arduino.

Our smartwatch in here measures your pulse, temperature and room temperature.

The smartwatch displays these information on an OLED display.

It's connected to your smartphone, you open its HTML page and click on which feature you would like to get it running. (NodeMCU only)
